# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has assigned to me and to Omar the task of summarizing ride-sharing data by city type to better optimize service for PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.4 via Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

## Results
What I was able to determine was the following:
-Urban service, as determined by fare, is consistently dominant over suburban and rural service, earning a total amount of $39,854.38 in fares generated.  By contranst, suburban service generated $19,356.33 in fares and rural service generated $4,327.93 in fares.
-Urban service, due to economies of scale, charged less in both average fare per ride and average fare per driver, respectively charging $24.53 and $16.57.  By contract, suburban service charged $30.97 and $39.50 and rural service charged $34.62 and $55.49.
-Urban service provided the most rides with the most riders, with 1,625 rides given by 2,405 drivers, compared to 625 rides given by 490 suburban drivers and 125 rides given by 78 rural drivers.

## Challenge Summary
The conclusion that I was able to reach is that urban service is both our most profitable and our most cost-effective division of service offered.  Despite charging less per ride and less per driver, our urban division has consistently delivered the most in revenue.  To this end, we should focus more on further augmenting our urban service, and with the profits earned, use them to cross-subsidize suburban and rural service, to the extent that the deficits in running suburban and rural service are not too great to cover.
